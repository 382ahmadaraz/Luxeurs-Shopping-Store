Delivery Policy<br />
<br />
We keep a little stock of our popular and running items but due to huge number of different designs normally the product is crafted to order. Once payment for an order is received the order details are added to our crafting list for the next available working day. Once a product has entered the crafting process it is usually completed within 7 to 10 working days. The average turnaround time from ordering to delivery is a week, but please allow a maximum of up to 15 days for complete fulfilment from the date of your payment.
<br /><br />
We will make you aware of any customisations you request that may take considerable time to complete.
Once a product has been crafted, it will go through a quality control stage and will then be packaged ready for
shipping. You will receive an email notifying you of the dispatch and containing the tracking number. All of our products are
shipped using a fully traceable carrier and you will be provided with the tracking details.<br /><br />

International orders are sent using DHL Air Express, Fedex or UPS. All deliveries will require a signature to receive the consignment, so we suggest that you specify a work address for delivery if you are not going to be at home.
<br /><br />
The delivery driver will call you on the contact number you provide for the delivery address if they have any issues with delivery
